**Challenge** 

Scenario -

Your grandmother has been given 5 bitcoins as a birthday present! - but unfortunately she is gung-ho for alt coins currently, and wants to sell all her bitcoins. Not knowing what the best deal is - she calls you to help her out.



Challenge -

Using React + Redux, create an app that monitors the prices for 3 alt coins - Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Monero. Prices should be displayed IN BITCOIN. Your app should display the most current price for each asset. On a different page, the app should display a list of prices from the last 30 minutes. Also be sure to highlight the best (lowest) and worse (highest) prices from each list for Grandma to see.
